# NLP-text-classification-on-a-given-dataset-of-news-articles
It is a Python script that performs text classification on a given dataset of news articles. The script utilizes a transformer-based model, such as BERT, to classify the articles into predefined categories. 
The dataset used here is the BBC NEWS SAMPLE SOLUTION.CSV file, where each row represents an article. This script reads the CSV file, preprocesses the text data, trains a transformer-based model for classification, and evaluates its performance.


THE STEPS INVOLVED HERE ARE

1. Writing a Python script that takes a CSV file containing news articles as input.
2. Preprocessing the text data by tokenizing, encoding, and padding the input sequences.
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Training a transformer-based model, such as BERT, for text classification.
5. Evaluating the model's performance by calculating relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
6. Output evaluation results and any additional insights or observations.
